        <p class="bio">I was born in Tehachapi, California and lived there for seventeen years. Afterwards, I moved to Madison Wisconsin. I went to school for Mechanical Engineering, but unfortunately my finances ran out and I left in my Junior year. I moved to Utah in 2015 and got a job working in the film industry as a Director's Assistant for Taylor Sheridan. Together we worked on the film WIND RIVER that went on to win multiple awards, and is currently available on Netflix.
        <br>
        Later, I got a job at a merchandising company and traveled around the US and Canada attending Comic Book, Video Game, and Anime conventions as a salesman. I received a promotion after my first year, and was the head of the entire department. I enjoyed this job very much; I traveled constantly, saw many cities I'd never visited before, got to sample the best foods every place had to offer, and expanded my cultural knowledge. Though, at the same time I was gone almost every holiday, and most of the summer. It was exhausting and extremely stressful. I also realized that I had reached my peak within the company; if I wanted to continue to grow as a person and in my career, I needed to complete some sort of skill-building education.
        <br>
        Thus, I found my way to the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I knew that coding would be a good fit for me, because my greatest strengths have always been attention to detail and organization. I also really enjoy logic games, puzzles, and problem-solving. I came into the program with no experience in coding, other than HTML on Myspace ten years ago, and two logic courses in college.
